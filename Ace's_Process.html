		<h2> How I was able to come up with the data </h2> 
	<p> Both players used various different techniques in order to create the final product. The most important factors that I will be talking about though, are Possession Time, Shot Selection, Matchup Quality, and Control. 
		<h4>Ace Bailey</h4>
			<ol> <li><u>Possession Time</u>
				<ul> <li> With Bailey, it was a little different. When I was doing this for Knueppel, I used mostly pen and paper, but for Ace Bailey, I decided to simplify it a little bit. I still used the same technique that I used for Knueppel to find possession time for Bailey, but this time, I had the help of a <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f_EBPiGWPxvnt0bBRUgAyPO-VTOWMOP5uFPoZVAYkW8/edit?gid=0#gid=0"> Google Sheet</a> to help digitize the data and make menial tasks such as division much simpler. I actually made a whole table for tracking possession, a possession type, as well as finding overall percentages of defenders guarding Bailey. After I found all the raw data, I made a footer at the bottom of the Sheet to add up all the overall possession times and add up the times that Bailey had the ball, using the =SUM function that is common among all spreadsheets. Then, after finding out the sum of both those values, I decided to take the Bailey possession time and divide by the overall using a simple math function (placing the Bailey time in front of the overall, and then putting a slash in between to show division). That's how I found out that the percentage of Bailey's possession while on the floor was 7%. </li> </ul> </li> 
			     <li><u>Shot Quality</u>
				<ul> <li> Bailey's Shot Quality was approached a little differently. This time, I used a digital shot chart that I made using <a href = "https://www.canva.com/design/DAG_cuk_ogg/-wtMZ2VkT_Ipl2Ct-iryug/edit?ui=eyJBIjp7IkIiOnsiQiI6dHJ1ZX19LCJFIjp7IkE_IjoiUCJ9LCJHIjp7IkIiOnRydWV9fQ&category=tAEv8Hh5on0">Canva</a>, which worked exactly the same as last time, but I was able to erase mistakes more easily, due to the non-permanent nature of the digital chart. He only took 4 shots, and made two, but 3 of them were threes, and he only made one of them. So I split his zones into 3: the wings, the corner, and the dunkers spot. Since he took more shots from the wing, that maintained the majority of the <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1041.jpeg">overall percentage</a>, while the rest, and especially the two point attempt, received less weight. That's how I came to the conclusion that Ace Bailey's shot quality was at 45% </li> </ul> </li>
			     <li><u>Control</u>
				<ul> <li> Bailey was graded on his control basically the same way that Knueppel was graded, with me counting all of Ace's touches when he was on the court, and added up positive stats (offensive rebounds (1), made shots (2.5*0.5)), and subtracted negative stats (fouls (3)). Notice that though he only had two makes, he was given a 2.5 for made shots, and this is due to me tweaking the stat in order to make it more fair, since one of his shots was a three (I divided his total points by the number of shots he took in this game to get that number). Then I divided this number by Ace's touches overall, and multiplied this <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1042.jpeg">number</a> by 10, to get 8.75 as Ace's control rating. </li> </ul> </li>
			     <li><u>Matchup Quality</u>
				<ul> <li>Using the  <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f_EBPiGWPxvnt0bBRUgAyPO-VTOWMOP5uFPoZVAYkW8/edit?gid=0#gid=0">Sheet</a>, I was able to use the techniques that I did for Kon, but in much less time, as the spreadsheet enables me to add up all the percentages and divide them by the number of overall possessions, so I was able to get a final percentage of Time Defending Ace Bailey for each player overall, which was Matas Buzelis for 53% of his time, Isaac Okoro 8% of the time, Kevin Huerter 16% of the time, Nikola Vucevic 1% of the time, Josh Giddey 2% of the time, Ayo Dosunmo 13% of the time, and Coby White for about 7% of the time. I also used the <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1044.jpeg">Lap method</a> (the one that I used to find possession time) instead of just checking the shotclock, in order to more accurately measure each defender's time on Ace as a primary defender. Then all I had to do was find their defensive ratings, multiply them by the percentage that they spent guarding Bailey, and then add that all up, for the final rating for the average defensive rating that Ace had to go against as <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1043.jpeg">117.88</a>. </li> </ul> </li> </ol>
