        <h1>Shot Selection</h1>
		<p> Shooting is a fundamental skill which all basketball players learn from their toddler days to even in a professional setting. I have heard a number of stories about NBA players receiving training in order to fix their jump shot, and some stories about a player refusing to do so as well. But one thing that really cannot be taught, is shot selection. <br> 
Shot Selection is something that players really need to learn in order to fully maximize their potential on the court. No shot is created equally, and that is very much apparent in the NBA as much as anywhere else. People have often heard about "low% shots" and "heaves" and other things that basically mean BAD SHOTS. But Shot Selection is relative. A shot that someone would airball 100% of the time could also be basically a layup for another person. That's why I'm aiming to track Shot Selection in game using frequency of taken shots as well as FG% to try and analyze a player's understanding of their shooting chart. </p>
