		<h2> How I was able to come up with the data </h2> 
	<p> Both players used various different techniques in order to create the final product. The most important factors that I will be talking about though, are Possession Time, Shot Selection, Matchup Quality, and Control. Click on each link to see proof of the process.

		<ul> <li> Kon Knueppel 
			<ol> <li><u>Possession Time</u>
				<ul> <li> In order to find out Kon's overall possession time in the game that I used for this study, I decided to use a stopwatch in order to try and accurately get his possession times in order so that the data would be accurate. Of course, there is always a margin for human error, but that's always a risk that you have to take with limited resources. <br> 
First, I always started the timer whenever someone on Kon's team touched the ball after the end of a defensive possession, and would use the Lap feature on the iPhone whenever Kon touched the ball. Whenever the ball changed hands from Kon to someone else's, I would hit Lap again as a way to show that Kon's time with the ball had ended at that point. If the ball got back into Kon's hands again, I would hit Lap again and the <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1039.jpeg"> cycle would continue</a>. Whenever the possession ended, I would write down the overall time of the possession as the denominator and look at every second lap in order to add up Kon's overall possession time to place as the numerator. I did this for <a href ="file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/Possessiontimetracker.jpg"> 47 possessions</a> . When the half was finished, and I was done recording all of this, I looked at all the denominators which I recorded, and added all of them up. I did the same with the <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Pictures/Numerator%20vs%20Denominator.jpg">numerators</a>. Then I just did basic division  in order to find out the percenatage of time in which he had the ball, and the number eventually came up to 15%. </li> </ul> </li> 
			     <li><u>Shot Selection</u>
				<ul> <li>This was easier to measure than the other stats. Kon took nine shots in this game, and made five of them. Using my own man made <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1040.jpeg"> Shot Chart</a>, where I tracked all of Kon's makes and misses, I was able to produce a data set based on where he took his shots and how efficient he was. Based on the number of shots that he took from each position, I gave a <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1023.jpeg"> percentage </a> which graded the frequency of the spot used to take a shot, and then multiplied those percentages with the actual shooting percentages of those spots, which eventually gave me the number 55% as his overall shot quality percentage. </li> </ul> </li> 
			     <li><u>Control</u>
				<ul> <li>Control is probably the stat which is the most fluctuating within this study, because without a control/average, I wasn't able to truly get a correct percentage. But alas, I <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1024.jpeg"> tried</a>. I counted all of Kon's touches when he was on the court, and added up positive stats, and subtracted negative stats. Negative stats were basically all of his misses (4) and his turnovers (3), while his positive stats included his steals (2) offensive rebounds (1) and his made shots, though I rewarded those slightly less than I did with misses (5*0.5). Then I divided this number by Kon's overall touches. Overall, I was able to get the number .952, which I then multiplied by 10 to get his final control rating of 9.52. </li> </ul> </li>
			     <li><u>Matchup Quality</u>
				<ul> <li>Doing this on paper would take a lot of time, and that's what I did. I rewatched the whole half, and especially possessions in which Kon was on the court, in order to find out who was guarding him, and for how long. I first looked at it the same way that I did with tracking overall Possession Time, which was I started my observations through watching for the beginning of the possession. Then, I watched Kon and his defender, as well as the shot clock. The shot clock told me exactly what I needed to know. For example, if a possession was 15 seconds long, and if Kon switched his defender at 16 on the shot clock, then I would know that his previous defender was guarding him for 8 seconds because there is 24 seconds overall on the shot clock (24-16=8 (you get the gist)), and if he only had two defenders on that possession, then the second defender would be guarding him for 7 seconds. I then used both numbers as numerators against the overall possession time (the denominator) and assigned percentages of Time of Defense to these players on a sheet of paper. I did this for <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/Defenders.jpeg">47 possessions of Kon's gameplay</a>. When I was finally done recording all of this data, I then went to work figuring out each defenders' percentage of overall time of defense against this one player. I did this by multiplying each possession time by the percentage of time each defender was against Kon for that possession, added them all up, took that number against the overall possession time, which was how I found out that <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1025.jpeg">Immanuel Quickley</a> guarded for 25% of Kon's time, <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1026.jpeg"> Brandon Ingram </a> 16% of the time, <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1027.jpeg">RJ Barrett </a> 15.9998% of the time, <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1028.jpeg"> Scottie Barnes </a> 7% of the time, <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1029.jpeg"> Collin Murray-Boyles </a> 9% of the time, <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1031.jpeg"> Grady Dick</a> 17% of the time, <a href ="file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1032.jpeg"> Jamal Shead </a> 5% of the time, <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1033.jpeg"> JaKobe Walters </a>5% of the time, and <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1038.jpeg"> Jakob Poeltl </a>for about 0.0002% of the time. I then took these percentages and multiplied all of these with the players' real life defensive rating, and added all of them up together. For example, if player A guarded player B for 1% of the time, and player C did the same for 99%, and they both had a defensive rating of 100, then I would've multiplied 100 with .01 for player A, and .99 with 100 for player C, and added them all up to get an average defensive rating of 100 against player B. The final average defensive rating going against Kon Knueppel was, in fact, <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1035.jpeg">114.19</a>. </li> </ul> </li> </ol> </li>
		  <li> Ace Bailey
			<ol> <li><u>Possession Time</u>
				<ul> <li> With Bailey, it was a little different. When I was doing this for Knueppel, I used mostly pen and paper, but for Ace Bailey, I decided to simplify it a little bit. I still used the same technique that I used for Knueppel to find possession time for Bailey, but this time, I had the help of a <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f_EBPiGWPxvnt0bBRUgAyPO-VTOWMOP5uFPoZVAYkW8/edit?gid=0#gid=0"> Google Sheet</a> to help digitize the data and make menial tasks such as division much simpler. I actually made a whole table for tracking possession, a possession type, as well as finding overall percentages of defenders guarding Bailey. After I found all the raw data, I made a footer at the bottom of the Sheet to add up all the overall possession times and add up the times that Bailey had the ball, using the =SUM function that is common among all spreadsheets. Then, after finding out the sum of both those values, I decided to take the Bailey possession time and divide by the overall using a simple math function (placing the Bailey time in front of the overall, and then putting a slash in between to show division). That's how I found out that the percentage of Bailey's possession while on the floor was 7%. </li> </ul> </li> 
			     <li><u>Shot Quality</u>
				<ul> <li> Bailey's Shot Quality was approached a little differently. This time, I used a digital shot chart that I made using <a href = "https://www.canva.com/design/DAG_cuk_ogg/-wtMZ2VkT_Ipl2Ct-iryug/edit?ui=eyJBIjp7IkIiOnsiQiI6dHJ1ZX19LCJFIjp7IkE_IjoiUCJ9LCJHIjp7IkIiOnRydWV9fQ&category=tAEv8Hh5on0">Canva</a>, which worked exactly the same as last time, but I was able to erase mistakes more easily, due to the non-permanent nature of the digital chart. He only took 4 shots, and made two, but 3 of them were threes, and he only made one of them. So I split his zones into 3: the wings, the corner, and the dunkers spot. Since he took more shots from the wing, that maintained the majority of the <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1041.jpeg">overall percentage</a>, while the rest, and especially the two point attempt, received less weight. That's how I came to the conclusion that Ace Bailey's shot quality was at 45% </li> </ul> </li>
			     <li><u>Control</u>
				<ul> <li> Bailey was graded on his control basically the same way that Knueppel was graded, with me counting all of Ace's touches when he was on the court, and added up positive stats (offensive rebounds (1), made shots (2.5*0.5)), and subtracted negative stats (fouls (3)). Notice that though he only had two makes, he was given a 2.5 for made shots, and this is due to me tweaking the stat in order to make it more fair, since one of his shots was a three (I divided his total points by the number of shots he took in this game to get that number). Then I divided this number by Ace's touches overall, and multiplied this <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1042.jpeg">number</a> by 10, to get 8.75 as Ace's control rating. </li> </ul> </li>
			     <li><u>Matchup Quality</u>
				<ul> <li>Using the  <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f_EBPiGWPxvnt0bBRUgAyPO-VTOWMOP5uFPoZVAYkW8/edit?gid=0#gid=0">Sheet</a>, I was able to use the techniques that I did for Kon, but in much less time, as the spreadsheet enables me to add up all the percentages and divide them by the number of overall possessions, so I was able to get a final percentage of Time Defending Ace Bailey for each player overall, which was Matas Buzelis for 53% of his time, Isaac Okoro 8% of the time, Kevin Huerter 16% of the time, Nikola Vucevic 1% of the time, Josh Giddey 2% of the time, Ayo Dosunmo 13% of the time, and Coby White for about 7% of the time. I also used the <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1044.jpeg">Lap method</a> (the one that I used to find possession time) instead of just checking the shotclock, in order to more accurately measure each defender's time on Ace as a primary defender. Then all I had to do was find their defensive ratings, multiply them by the percentage that they spent guarding Bailey, and then add that all up, for the final rating for the average defensive rating that Ace had to go against as <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1043.jpeg">117.88</a>. </li> </ul> </li> </ol> </li> </ul>
