		<h2> How I was able to come up with the data </h2> 
	<p> Both players used various different techniques in order to create the final product. The most important factors that I will be talking about though, are Possession Time, Shot Selection, Matchup Quality, and Control.  
		<h4>Kon Knueppel</h4>
			<ol> <li><u>Possession Time</u>
				<ul> <li> In order to find out Kon's overall possession time in the game that I used for this study, I decided to use a stopwatch in order to try and accurately get his possession times in order so that the data would be accurate. Of course, there is always a margin for human error, but that's always a risk that you have to take with limited resources. <br> 
First, I always started the timer whenever someone on Kon's team touched the ball after the end of a defensive possession, and would use the Lap feature on the iPhone whenever Kon touched the ball. Whenever the ball changed hands from Kon to someone else's, I would hit Lap again as a way to show that Kon's time with the ball had ended at that point. If the ball got back into Kon's hands again, I would hit Lap again and the <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1039.jpeg"> cycle would continue</a>. Whenever the possession ended, I would write down the overall time of the possession as the denominator and look at every second lap in order to add up Kon's overall possession time to place as the numerator. I did this for <a href ="file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/Possessiontimetracker.jpg"> 47 possessions</a> . When the half was finished, and I was done recording all of this, I looked at all the denominators which I recorded, and added all of them up. I did the same with the <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Pictures/Numerator%20vs%20Denominator.jpg">numerators</a>. Then I just did basic division  in order to find out the percenatage of time in which he had the ball, and the number eventually came up to 15%. </li> </ul> </li> 
			     <li><u>Shot Selection</u>
				<ul> <li>This was easier to measure than the other stats. Kon took nine shots in this game, and made five of them. Using my own man made <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1040.jpeg"> Shot Chart</a>, where I tracked all of Kon's makes and misses, I was able to produce a data set based on where he took his shots and how efficient he was. Based on the number of shots that he took from each position, I gave a <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1023.jpeg"> percentage </a> which graded the frequency of the spot used to take a shot, and then multiplied those percentages with the actual shooting percentages of those spots, which eventually gave me the number 55% as his overall shot quality percentage. </li> </ul> </li> 
			     <li><u>Control</u>
				<ul> <li>Control is probably the stat which is the most fluctuating within this study, because without a control/average, I wasn't able to truly get a correct percentage. But alas, I <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1024.jpeg"> tried</a>. I counted all of Kon's touches when he was on the court, and added up positive stats, and subtracted negative stats. Negative stats were basically all of his misses (4) and his turnovers (3), while his positive stats included his steals (2) offensive rebounds (1) and his made shots, though I rewarded those slightly less than I did with misses (5*0.5). Then I divided this number by Kon's overall touches. Overall, I was able to get the number .952, which I then multiplied by 10 to get his final control rating of 9.52. </li> </ul> </li>
			     <li><u>Matchup Quality</u>
				<ul> <li>Doing this on paper would take a lot of time, and that's what I did. I rewatched the whole half, and especially possessions in which Kon was on the court, in order to find out who was guarding him, and for how long. I first looked at it the same way that I did with tracking overall Possession Time, which was I started my observations through watching for the beginning of the possession. Then, I watched Kon and his defender, as well as the shot clock. The shot clock told me exactly what I needed to know. For example, if a possession was 15 seconds long, and if Kon switched his defender at 16 on the shot clock, then I would know that his previous defender was guarding him for 8 seconds because there is 24 seconds overall on the shot clock (24-16=8 (you get the gist)), and if he only had two defenders on that possession, then the second defender would be guarding him for 7 seconds. I then used both numbers as numerators against the overall possession time (the denominator) and assigned percentages of Time of Defense to these players on a sheet of paper. I did this for <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/Defenders.jpeg">47 possessions of Kon's gameplay</a>. When I was finally done recording all of this data, I then went to work figuring out each defenders' percentage of overall time of defense against this one player. I did this by multiplying each possession time by the percentage of time each defender was against Kon for that possession, added them all up, took that number against the overall possession time, which was how I found out that <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1025.jpeg">Immanuel Quickley</a> guarded for 25% of Kon's time, <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1026.jpeg"> Brandon Ingram </a> 16% of the time, <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1027.jpeg">RJ Barrett </a> 15.9998% of the time, <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1028.jpeg"> Scottie Barnes </a> 7% of the time, <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1029.jpeg"> Collin Murray-Boyles </a> 9% of the time, <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1031.jpeg"> Grady Dick</a> 17% of the time, <a href ="file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1032.jpeg"> Jamal Shead </a> 5% of the time, <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1033.jpeg"> JaKobe Walters </a>5% of the time, and <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1038.jpeg"> Jakob Poeltl </a>for about 0.0002% of the time. I then took these percentages and multiplied all of these with the players' real life defensive rating, and added all of them up together. For example, if player A guarded player B for 1% of the time, and player C did the same for 99%, and they both had a defensive rating of 100, then I would've multiplied 100 with .01 for player A, and .99 with 100 for player C, and added them all up to get an average defensive rating of 100 against player B. The final average defensive rating going against Kon Knueppel was, in fact, <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1035.jpeg">114.19</a>. </li> </ul> </li> </ol>
