        <h1>Ace Bailey</h1>
        <p>Evaluating Ace Bailey using my current model. This will use most of the same metrics that I did for Kon as well as evaluate him as a separate prospect. This is also a personal project of mine where I attempt to understand why Ace's production isn't exactly matching his "projected" talent for this season.</p>

<ol>
		<li>Creator Opinion <ul>
			<li> 5/10 player, below average </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Possession Time<ul>
			<li> Ace Bailey had the ball 7% of his teams overall offensive touches while he was playing. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>No. of Touches<ul>
			<li> Ace Bailey had 4 touches within a half of gametime </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Shots<ul>
		 	<li>He took 4 shots and made 2 </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Shot Selection<ul>
			<li> 2/4 overall, 1/1 from dunkers spot, 1/2 from the wings, and 0/1 from the corner (since he took the same number of shots from both wings, we're going to evaluate it as one spot). 45% overall shot quality  </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Heat Map<ul>
			<li> Rotates around the corners very much, and doesn't really do much changing of position except off-ball screens to other teammates. Used mostly as a decoy to space the floor for the Jazz.  </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Off Ball Movement<ul>
			<li> Ace Bailey was mostly in the corner and as part of motions in order create spacing for the team overall. Also sets a lot of off-ball screens where he's usually down-low in the corner freeing up space for someone or switching to create a favorable matchup. Half of his shots came from switching his matchup from Buzelis to another player, and those shots directly lead to him scoring points. His average depth of separation was 6.83ft</li> </ul></li>
		<li>Matchup quality<ul>
			<li> Ace Bailey matched up with Matas Buzelis for 53% of his time, Isaac Okoro 8% of the time, Kevin Huerter 16% of the time, Nikola Vucevic 1% of the time, Josh Giddey 2% of the time, Ayo Dosunmo 13% of the time, and Coby White for about 7% of the time, and his defender had a defensive rating, on average, of about 117.88. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Team Situation<ul>
			<li> Will Hardy at the beginning of the season stated that he believes that Ace Bailey needed to work more on off-ball things as well as get into a routine and rhythm, suggesting that the rookie is very out of control and is not going to be a main piece in the offense until he gets fully ready to contribute as a main player to play off of Markkenan and George. Stated that he has a "lot of potential", referring to his athletic frame and ability, but speaking to his polish as lacking. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Coaching Scheme<ul>
			<li>Will Hardy spoke to John Stockton about how to be a better playmaker, referring to small guard and big dynamics, which is very apparent in this current Jazz model as it is very noticeable the size of the Utah Jazz on the court versus their opponent and have made Keyonte and Lauri the focal points of the offensive with various PnR actions. This means that they have the ball the most and others revolve around them. This is why Ace is located near the corner in order to space out for their actions. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>BPM+<ul>
			<li>Ace was a +3 while the rest of the team was a -9, but limited minutes need to be taken into considered. He played 1 minute overall in the second quarter due to fouling twice, which makes this overall number a lie in general. To describe the chemistry of the team while he was gone wouldn't really matter as the spots were just filled after he got out. He offers a lot more athleticism in the lineup, but overall the plan doesn't change, except when Isaiah Collier is on, when the Jazz try to push the pace a little faster than usual.</li> </ul></li>
		<li>Pace<ul>
			<li> Has bursts of speed due to his athleticism, and is a very reliable defender, but he doesn't demonstrate it much as the opportunity isn't presented as much. This is due to his positioning on the court as a shooter and not as a traditional wing. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Control<ul>
			<li> His offensive control isn't very bad, but on the defensive end, he had a lot of fouls, as he was unable to play a lot of basketball in the second quarter due to this "aggressiveness". He got an overall grade of 79% for his control using the same stat that I used for Kon </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Quarterly Performance<ul>
			<li> All of his production in terms of points came in the first quarter and he didn't even attempt a single shot nor record a single stat in the second quarter due to his limited minutes as a result of fouls. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>EOG Stats (Counting Stats)<ul>
			<li> 5pts, 1 (o)rbs, 0 asts, 3 pfs, 0 TOVs. </li> </ul></li>

<h2><u> Conclusion </u></h2>

<p> Ace Bailey wasn't really able to make much of an impact on the court, due to Will Hardy's two man system where the play mainly goes through Keyonte George and Lauri Markennan. That's one of the reasons why he only had 7% of his overall team possession when he was on, even though the spacing allowed him to have 6.83 degrees of separation. Despite this lack of possession, he was able to control the ball quite well, even though he fouled a lot in this game, not turning it over once, though he does need improvement on his overall shot quality, as he is still figuring out the shots which he needs to take and where he is most efficient.  </p>
