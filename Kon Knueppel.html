        <h1>Kon Knueppel</h1>
        <p>First official attempt with the current model. <br> Everything will be included in the list below, which will be very beneficiary to my work. </p>

<ol>
		<li>Creator Opinion <ul>
			<li> 9/10 Shooter, 7/10 player, pretty much average IMO </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Possession Time<ul>
			<li> Kon Knueppel had 15% of his teams overall touches and possession time. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>No. of Touches<ul>
			<li> Kon Knueppel had 31 touches within a half of gametime </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Shots<ul>
		 	<li>He took 9 shots and made 5 </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Shot Selection<ul>
			<li> 5/9 overall, 2/3 from dunkers spot, 2/2 left corner threes, 1/2 right wing threes, 0/1 left wing and right corner threes equals  55% overall  shot selection. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Heat Map<ul>
			<li> Stayed mostly in the corner as a shooter, developing the spacing within Charlotte's game as well providing the player's with a safety blanket for a quick pass to the corner. Gained possession of the ball from the backcourt as well on some actions.  </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Off Ball Movement<ul>
			<li> Kon Knueppel was used as a screener in a lot of actions, which helped to free up his teammates as well as give them an option as these were high ball screens, which he used to pop out and shoot whenever he got the ball after a screen. His average depth of separation was 8.48ft</li> </ul></li>
		<li>Matchup quality<ul>
			<li> Kon Knueppel matched up with Immanuel Quickley for 25% of his time, Brandon Ingram 16% of the time, RJ Barrett 15.9998% of the time, Scottie Barnes 7% of the time, Collin Murray-Boyles 9% of the time, Grady Dick 17% of the time, Jamal Shead 5% of the time, JaKobe Walters 5% of the time, and Jakob Poeltl for about 0.0002% of the time, and his defender had a defensive rating, on average, of about 114.19. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Team Situation<ul>
			<li> Charles Lee stated that he feels that Kon Knueppel is very competitive, and has a very high IQ. Expect a lot of offensive rebounding and rebounding attempts, as well as a high level of control. On Ball defense will be another point to look out for. Judge his passes by assist-worthy plays </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Coaching Scheme<ul>
			<li>Mainly have two main on-ball guys in Tre Mann and Lamelo to run the offense. Kon usually stays in the corners, though sometimes he comes up for screens which confuse the defenses into leaving him open for an open three. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>BPM+<ul>
			<li>Kon was a -4 while the rest of the team was a -1, though this was due to excess fouling and a whole lot of turnovers in-game. Despite this, team chemistry seemed to lack in the minutes he was off the floor as well as defensive structure, because the Raptors were able to get many open three looks during the Kon-less minutes, outside of Immanuel Quickley. They also turned the ball over 3 times in a 2 minute sequence while Kon was out, and the higher +/- was due to fouls and the bonus happening late in the second quarter, when Kon was out. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Pace<ul>
			<li> Moves very slowly, as he doesn't sacrifice any energy within his play. Maintains most of his position as a spot up shooter in the corner, which is where he maintained most of his looks and possessions. Doesn't really push in transition much except for when he gets a steal, and even then, he usually passes it to a faster teammate in order for them to get a bucket. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Control<ul>
			<li> The Control Stat is a little bit wonky, but the most preferable percentage that I found was 95%, which was still too high.</li> </ul></li>
		<li>Quarterly Performance<ul>
			<li> Kon's Shooting Splits were better in the second quarter, but his overall production as a basketball player decreased, due to a decrease in overall rebounding, as well as an increase in TOs. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>EOG Stats (Counting Stats)<ul>
			<li> 13pts, 3 rbs, 0 asts, 2 stls, 3 TOVs. </li> </ul></li>
	</ol>

<h2><u> Conclusion </u></h2>

<p> Kon Knueppel is a player who possesses a large amount of poise, especially at his young age, whenever he gets the ball, due to the fact that despite only having 15% of his team's overall possessions, he always managed give himself lots of opportunity to get open easily, due to him able to get about 8.48 ft of separation at all times. He's also a very reliable shooter, used a lot in catch and shoot situations, and he definitely has an understanding of when and how to take his shots. </p>
