		<h2> How do they stack up against each other, and how do they do against the average NBA player?</h2>
			<p> Obviously, as talented as they both are, and though they were right after each other on the draft board, it's hard to fully compare the two players due to the lack of opportunity given to Ace Bailey. A talented basketball player in his own right, he averaged 30 ppg in high school! (more than Cooper Flagg, and he was the No.1 overall prospect in the class). But in order to really compare, we have to dive a lot deeper into their individual statistics, and really attempt to determine precisely just how effective they were in their own minutes on the offensive side of the ball. To do this, we are going to look at "Usage" (though it is a stat in the NBA, I'm making a new one based on type of usage that the player has within the system), BPM+, and Matchup Quality. <br><br>
One thing to mention is that both players are starters on their team. That's a pretty important factor when evaluating their performance, because according to their coach, they are considered valuable pieces in their team for the purpose of winning. It's not just comparing an actual starter against an end of the bench guy, because they both do start. But it's obvious that their roles are different. Take Kon Knueppel for example. He has an average separation factor of 8.48, but that number is mostly flawed due to the places in which he receives the ball. Sometimes, he gets the ball in the back court and helps to run plays, and sometimes he spots up as a shooter. This can be measured in the range of the data tracking the separation between him and his defender, which is a large number of 49 ft. That means that Kon received the ball within a data set that included 49 different numbers, meaning that he received the ball from various places around the floor. With Ace, however, he wasn't as used on offense as much as Kon. He created 6.83 ft of separation for himself as well, but that was due to him receiving the ball mostly outside the three point line, where defense and coverage is usually consistently softer, leading to higher spacing numbers. In fact, his average degree of separation was 4. <br><br>
This shows a wide difference in between their play styles and team structure, especially due to the fact that both players were drafted for these specific purposes. Kon was drafted out of college as a player with remarkable shooting upside, and fits within the Hornets structure as someone that can consistently knock down shots and give the man ball handlers some safety when passing. Ace Bailey is considered a very raw prospect, as he possesses a lot of important tools to be a star NBA player, but he's very inconsistent, and doesn't really have a lot of control. At least that's what I think Will Hardy thinks. By limiting his role, and forcing him to be a secondary option instead of being as involved in the offense as Lauri and Keyonte, I think he's trying to suppress the number of decisions that Ace makes. I mean, in game, out of the 17 possessions that I watched Ace play, he only had the ball 4 times, exemplifying his limited role. <br> This is also evident when watching both teams play without these players. With Kon Knueppel, when he left the court, the ball handlers were left without one of their main options, forcing them to have a heavier load, and even pushing the pace a little bit. This lead to a stretch where the Hornets turned the ball over 3 times in 2 minutes. Their defense was also a lot less stable. Charles Lee has stated to the media that he believes that Kon Knueppel has a very high basketball iq, and works very hard, which is evident with his effort on the offensive glass. But it's also evident when he's off the floor, as when he leaves, the Hornets perimeter defense somehow collapse, perhaps due to a large hole being created on the inside when Kon leaves, which allowed the Raptors to take many threes, and even make most of them. Before he left the floor, Immanuel Quickley was basically the only guy that shot threes. But a number of players were able to get open when Kon eventually subbed out of the game. Though Kon's BPM (-4)compared to the rest of the team's BPM (-1), it was obvious that it was a product of the situation as well, as when Kon left in the second quarter, the Raptors were in the bonus, leading to a lot more free throws for the Hornets, definitely impacting their BPM by a lot.  <br> <br>
Ace Bailey is a talented defender for sure. Large arms, tall frame, high athleticism, he's everything you could ever want in an NBA defender. But despite this, the control on the defensive end is still lacking. 3 fouls in 7 minutes does not exactly indicate control, which was a main reason why Ace didn't really play that much in the second quarter at all, despite being a starter, since he had 2 fouls in only a minute of gametime in that quarter. This, along with his limited role as a spacer within George and Markennan's two man game caused the minutes without him to be very much unchanged. I mean, they used Kevin Love a lot more on actions than they do with Bailey. He's essentially only used as a baseline runner on some actions, where he receives off-ball screens and rarely gets the ball, and isn't able to do as much due to Will Hardy valuing experience over raw ability with Kevin Love. It makes sense, as the Jazz are still trying to find their identity as a team, and I expect that Bailey's role will change eventually during the season, but it honestly seems kind of tragic how little he produces on the team. I expect that he probably thrives in lineups with Isaiah Collier, where he's able to show off his athleticism due to Collier's ability to push the pace, but I have yet to see both of them on the same court, which is why this is all just speculation at this point, since Bailey really hasn't been able to show what he can do with other lineups. <br><br>
Both wings have shown significant scoring talent, with Kon's shooting, and Ace's athleticism. And though their roles are unequal, I wanted to examine just how much they get out of their matchups. Defensive Rating literally means how much points are being scored per 100 possessions, which gives us a decent way to measure scoring output. Basically, we can take total possessions for each player, then multiply it by the defensive rating/100, look at the number of points which they scored and divide that by total possessions, and then take both numbers and subtract the latter with the former. It should look something like this <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1045.jpeg">example</a>. The lower the number, the better the offensive output. So I did just that. <br>
With Kon, his defenders' average drtg was 114.19. He had 47 overall possessions, and he scored 13 points. This means that the formula should look like <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1047.jpeg">this</a>.<br>
With Ace, his defenders' average drtg was 117.88. He had 17 overall possessions, significantly less than Kon, and he scored 5 points. This means that the formula should look like <a href = "file:///C:/Users/Jayeward_973041/Downloads/IMG_1046.jpeg">this</a>. <br>
Again, context is important. With less offensive possessions, it's obviously easier for a player to have a higher offensive output if they only scored less points than the other player. This is a flawed stat. But it doesn't mean to discredit Ace Bailey. He is a talented offensive player in his own right, which would've allowed him to have more frequent scoring opportunities in his limited than Kon (his athleticism provides him with far more offensive upside as well). This allows him to maximize his defenisve matchups, giving him more points as a result. <br> <br> 
Overall, this attempts to draw a barrier, or a bridge, in between NBA box score watchers, and real NBA fans. I don't think that if someone was looking at stats on Twitter, they would be able to figure out that the Jazz don't really provide Ace with much to work with. I think they would've said, "Ohhhh, he sucks", or "Yeah he's a bust". But there needs to be an understanding of the context within the NBA landscape. It's the same thing with Kon. People need to watch his games in order to see why he's regarded as the Rookie of the Year. Through his efficiency and shooting, he's become a very reliable piece in the Hornets offense, but it's also important to note that he does also have a decent defensive role within the team. That's one of the reasons why he stays of the floor as well. Most importantly, he gives the Hornets a steady ground on which to work with due to his poise with the ball and ability to limit turnovers due to his presence. For instance, I didn't see a two minute stretch where the Hornets turned it over 3 times when he was on the floor. Through this analysis, I have been able to identify context around a player's situation, and even figure out reasons behind their production. This should really be explored as something that basketball fans really should look at, in order to educate themselves about the sport that  they love.
