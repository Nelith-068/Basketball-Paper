        <h1>This will be a Test, for this whole experiment and page</h1>
        <p>I will make a prediction for the game today: Cameron Boozer will hold a bulk of the offensive load and the team will use a lot of P'n'R actions to get easy buckets through him. He will receive a lot of attention from an SMU team which is ranked 75th in the country in overall defensive rating. This data will be evaluated through a half of real basketball gameplay</p>
 
	<p>Here is a list that directly connects to the Criteria in the previous page</p>
<ol>
		<li>Creator Opinion <ul>
			<li> I would say that Cameron Boozer is a 9/10 college basketball player. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Possession Time<ul>
			<li> Cameron Boozer had 22% of his teams overall possession time. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>No. of Touches<ul>
			<li> Was Unable to come up with overall data, so I'll use his overall possessions and posession time as an example: 22% possession time + 9 touches</li> </ul></li>
		<li>Shots<ul>
			<li> 3 shots </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Shot Selection<ul>
			<li> 1/3 from three spots = 33% </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Heat Map<ul>
			<li> Through observation, early in the shot clock he starts off up top to help his guards but mostly handles himself near the high post.  </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Off Ball Movement<ul>
			<li> Cameron Boozer got the ball back once in his nine overall touches, and his average ft of separation was 2</li> </ul></li>
		<li>Matchup quality<ul>
			<li> Cameron Boozer would've faced defenders that had an average of a 105.25 Defensive Rating, which is below average. </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Team Situation<ul>
			<li> Jon Scheyer has stated that Cameron Boozer has a very coachable ability about him, suggesting his versatility.  </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Coaching Scheme<ul>
			<li>Duke took mostly threes in this game, which meant using Cameron as a powerful screener and using his gravity to create open shots for his team</li> </ul></li>
		<li>BPM+<ul>
			<li>Cameron Boozer wasn't off the floor as I was studying his game today. Duke won by 7 today</li> </ul></li>
		<li>Pace<ul>
			<li> Cameron Boozer appears to be a very effective back to the basket player, and he seems to use more power than pace in his game.  </li> </ul></li>
		<li>Control<ul>
			<li> Cameron Boozer didn't turn the ball over today in the 9 touches that I saw, but he did miss two shots where the possession ended in SMU's favor, giving his control rating a 77.8</li> </ul></li>
		<li>Quarterly Performance<ul>
			<li> I could not track quarterly performances as I only watched the game from the second half. </li> </ul></li>

<h2> Conclusions </h2>
<p> This was a test, so it wasn't an overall measure of my abilities. Through this test, I am able to figure out more of how I can fix the current model and how I can improve certain metrics such as the control metric as well as the shot selection metric. I will also figure out a way to link other online pages in order to help me with the overall statkeeping and analysis.<br>
<p> Prior research such as Player Defensive Rating, Coach Interviews, Shot Type Percentage, they are all needed to make this the best possible model for my goals and I want to document them in order to fully capture the true strength of statistics and basketball. </p>
