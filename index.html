        <h1>Narratives and Context: A Study into the Nature of NBA Basketball</h1>
        <p>By Nelith Jayewardene, sophomore at Austin Vandegrift High School</p>
 
	<p>Basketball fans around the world like to call themselves fans, through viewing highlight tapes and looking at box scores. Great for the growth of the sport, but really terrible when people claim to know about basketball without actually watching the sport. Though numbers have apparently ruined the conversation about basketball, I'm attempting to use them to my advantage, and provide context towards narratives that are chased by NBA Media. Through bust allegations and even Rookie of the Year nominations, I try to use numbers to add a layer to these conversations and provide evidence to back these claims up, or refute them.<br>
The players that I looked at were chosen due to personal interest, due to their attention within the media as well as box scores skewing peoples' opinions of these players. These players are:
<ol> 
<li> Kon Knueppel </li> 
<li> Ace Bailey </li> 
</ol>
With Kon as my first choice, I really wanted to examine precisely his overall impact as a Hornet. His reputation intrigued me since he's being touted as a potential Rookie of the Year, despite going up against a generational talent, Cooper Flagg. Especially since Cooper Flagg is living up to his generation standards, I wanted to really examine what makes Kon so effective. <br> 
With Ace Bailey, there was a lot of off-season drama about where he was going to go in the NBA draft, due to his agents actions. And when he finally ended up in Utah, it seemed like a place where he would fully get to shine. But so far into this season, it hasn't seemed like he's making much of an impact despite his high draft pick, and I wanted to really figure out the reason why his production was so limited.<br>
In order to do that though, I need to set up the foundation of this whole study. In order to really look at these players through a new lens, one has to imagine that he needs to create that new lens in the first place. That's what I did with my Criteria List, where I list off the metrics and analysis points which I am using in order to generate my analysis. These are all new metrics that I created myself; but I really want to examine exactly how I created them and for what purpose. In order to do this, I need to really go in depth. For you to see this, you need to go to the Criteria List above in order to find out.</p>
