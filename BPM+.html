        <h1>BPM+</h1>
		<p> Player's performance can also be measured by how well their team does whenever they are not on the court versus when they are. But in the case of Nikola Jokic, teams either have to adjust and changed up their game plan whenever their best player is not on the court. BPM+ is a combination of box plus/minus as well as personal observations by myself in order to understand the adjustments that the team makes whenever a player comes out of the game. It attempts to measure chemistry, impact, and precisely the value and versatility that the player being evaluated brings to the team. </p>
