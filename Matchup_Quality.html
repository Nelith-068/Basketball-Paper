        <h1>Matchup Quality</h1>
		<p> When discussing the topic of the NBA's defensive player of the year, people always like to mention stats about stocks, opponent field goal percentage, and mainly their defensive rating. But this is about offensive evaluation. So I attempted to find out the number of defenders a player is being guarded by, in order to calculate the average defensive rating that the player I'm evaluating is being guarded by. <br>

(Find average drtg and subtract from MQ, and the difference will determine if performance is good or bad). </p>
